**Custom Drop Down Menu**

An example of a custom drop down menu. Main features:
- an extended initializer that allows you to customize the appearance of the drop down menu
- built-in table view with datasource and delegate

At the moment, this is the first version - which will be expanded gradually, new features will be added - up to the creation of a full-fledged library

How to use: 
1) add files CustomDropDown.swift and CustomDropDownAnimations and OpenAdressDelegate
2) FirstViewController as an example of your controller and SecondViewController as a screen that opens when you click on the add button
- inside there is a textfield in which you can enter anything and when you click on the add button,
- the selected text will be transferred to the drop down menu of the first screen
- 
customize the cell and table as desired.

the main essence is in the file customDropDown and customDropDownAnimation

**Good luck :)**
